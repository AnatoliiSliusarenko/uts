			<h3>NinjaTrader is the industry leader in trade management features!</h3>
			<p>Advanced Trade Management (ATM) is NinjaTrader’s signature order management technology that lets you pre-define personal trade management strategies including; multiple profit targets and stop loss orders, one-cancels-other (OCO) orders, auto-breakeven stops, trailing stops and much more. This feature can significantly enhance trade performance by automatically submitting all entry/exit orders within milliseconds! This feature alone tends to cover the cost of the platform while simultaneously lowering your stress level by eliminating the “deer in the headlights” feeling commonly associated with manually managing multiple exit orders in fast moving markets.</p>
